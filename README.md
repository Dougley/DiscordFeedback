# DiscordFeedback

This repo is hosting the now discontinued code for the official feedback server.

Discord opted to use only in-house developed tools instead, and aksed voluenteer developers to halt all development immediatly, this repo is no longer accepting pull requests or issues because of that.

The code in this repo is released into the public domain in the hope that it will be useful to someone, there's no guarantee for the fitness of the program.
